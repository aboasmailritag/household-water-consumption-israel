# Household Water Consumption Analysis in Israel (1998–2022)

## Overview
This project analyzes long-term trends in household and non-agricultural water consumption in Israel between 1998 and 2022. The objective is to examine whether household water consumption has changed over time and to identify structural shifts.

## Research Question
How has household water consumption changed over time in Israel?

## Data Source
Israel Water Authority – General Water Consumption Survey (1998–2022).

## Methodology
Representative years were selected from official time-series data published by the Israel Water Authority. Consumption values were extracted from published charts and analyzed using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques in Python.

## Tools
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

## Analysis
A time-series line plot was used to visualize household water consumption over time. Additionally, average consumption levels before and after 2015 were compared to identify structural changes.

## Key Findings
- Household water consumption shows an overall increasing trend from 1998 to 2022.
- A significant rise in average consumption is observed after 2015.
- Average consumption increased from approximately 665 million m³ before 2015 to about 793 million m³ after 2015.

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates a clear upward trend in household water consumption in Israel over the studied period. The noticeable increase after 2015 suggests changes in consumption behavior, population growth, and water management practices.

## Notes
Consumption values were approximated from official published charts. This approach is common in exploratory data analysis when raw datasets are not directly available.
